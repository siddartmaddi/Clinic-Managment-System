# Clinic-Managment-System

The Project aims to implement a database infrastructure for clinic management systems.
The project has a trigger implementation to enforce some constraints in the schema as well as referential integrity constraints between all tables.
Project checks for lossless decomposition and we have also implemented the creation of tables using check constraints
The project is implemented in Postgresql running on Mac OS.
